# NBS Challenge 3

## What was the challenge?

The challenge was to create an app with a Jenkins pipeline(automating the pipeline), and for the app to be updated for every push to the repository using the Poll SCM,the app should be tested.I should also create a Docker image and push to Nexus

  
How I expected the challenge to go.
 I expected the challenge to be fair and better than week 2 as I was able to complete most of the tutorials in class this week and I am aware that the challenge is a combination of all I have learnt in the last three weeks
- What went well?
I was able to better navigate the system, committing changes to the Git repo has been a bit of a challenge in the last 2 weeks but it went well this week and I am getting more familiar with the commands and the lingo

- What didn't go as planned?
My Jenkins pipeline did not build, build kept failing

- Possible improvements for future challenges.
I need to keep at it, go
